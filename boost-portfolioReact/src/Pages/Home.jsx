       <p> Hi everyone! I'm Vai! I'm a new programmer who loves old web aesthetics and wants to revive personal blogs, colorful profiles
        and them whimsy of a non-uniform internet. This website has two versions.
        One of a standard user friendly view of the website. It does it's job and is easy to view for all your recruiters.
        The other version I made for fun and to showcase my skills.
        You can choose your theme in the top corner
       </p>
